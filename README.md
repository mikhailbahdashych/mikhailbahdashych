<h1>
  Hello, World! I'm Mikhail :wave:
</h1>

I am a lifetime learner with an endless desire to grow on oneself, work, learn and teach others interesting new things in field if AL/ML, Cybersecurity and Software Engineering. I am the type of person who is constantly looking for new opportunities and new experiences, and also strives to apply the acquired experience and knowledge as quickly as possible.

What am I doing and why am I doing that? Well, I am just trying to make this world a little better place.
